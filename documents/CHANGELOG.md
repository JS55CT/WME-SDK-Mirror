### Fixed link for TS typings in documentation

The issue occurred because the placeholder %%WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%% is used
within a href attribute of the README.md file. URLs have specific character
restrictions, and the % character is not allowed without encoding.
So %%WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%% was encoded to %25%25WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%25%25.
When sed was trying to replace was %%WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%% with real string, there
was no %%WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%% but %25%25WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%25%25.
To resolve this, the placeholder was changed from %%WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL%%
to --WME_SDK_TYPINGS_URL--. The - character is allowed within URLs,
so it is not encoded and could be properly replaced with the actual URL during
the subsequent substitution step in the upload_sdk_docs.sh script.

migrated in a follow-up CL.

### Arg validator to preserve the original method name

a wrong value. Update the e2e test.

### Add Map.drawLine() helper method

### Add Map.drawPolygon() helper method

### Add Map.drawPoint() helper method

Add a way to draw a point on the map. The point is drawn on the sketch

methods (i.e. addNode())

### Don't allow to override existing shortcuts

## v2.237

### Report get sdk event

Report an event when a userscript requests an sdk
reference.

### Pass script id to sdk modules

Pass the script id which was used to initialize an
sdk instance into the Sidebar module which requires
it to register the sidebar tab.
Previously, registering the sidebar required passing
the script id again.

### Remove users data model from sdk

Remove exposure of users data model from the sdk in order
to not expose user ids (PII).
Instead, add modification meta data to other data models
so scripts can get the relevant information from there
(createdBy/On, updatedBy/On). Instead of exposing user ids,
get the createdBy/updatedBy username which is publicly displayed
in the UI.

### Add isPracticeMode & isSnapshotMode

Add the methods isPracticeMode & isSnapshotMode
to sdk editing Module. Also move isEditingHouseNumbers
getter from WmeState to Editing module.

### Add username to logged in user

Add username (publicly visible) to logged in
user data. This was already added and removed
due to privacy concerns. Since the username
is publicly visible (e.g. in edit history),
we can add it back.

### Add SdkArgumentValidator to all SDK methods with args

### Add decorator that validates options with yup

Add an SdkArgumentValidator decorator that validates sdk method options
object using yup. If there's an error, a ValidationError is thrown.
The Actions object became a class with a static method because
decorators in object literal aren't working [0].
[0]: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5770

### Reduce data exposed for logged in user

Following design review and scripter feedback,
reduce the data exposed when getting the logged in
user state to only return:
isAreaManager
isCountryManager
rank
This can be augmented as required in the future.
The user data was added in http://wger/942992 .

### Add getUserSettings method

Add method to getUserSettings which returns
a subset of the preferences model.
Currently returns isImperial and isCompactMode, based
on the scripts usage.
Return a single object instead of individual methods
for simplicity.

## v2.236

### Add DataModel.Venues.updateVenue() helper method

add a method to cover the UpdateObject & UpdateFeatureGeometry actions
use case for venues for userscripts

### Add Segments.updateSegment() method

add a method to cover the UpdateObject & UpdateFeatureGeometry actions
use case for segments for userscripts

### Define a VenueCategory type for SDK

- define a separate VenueCategory type with an id and localized name

- use it in the Venues.addVenue()

- add Venues.getVenueCategories() method that returns all available
venue categories and their translations

- add a snapshot test for the getVenueCategories() to ensure that we
won't implicitly change the set of known venue categories

### Add Actions.addAlternateStreet() helper function

add a method to cover the AddAlternateStreet action use case for
userscripts

### Add Actions.addStreet() and Streets.getStreet() helpers

Add two method to cover the AddOrGetStreet action use case for
userscripts. Separate adding & getting the street for better dev UX.

### Add Actions.addCity() and Cities.getCity() helper functions

Add two method to cover the AddOrGetCity action use case for
userscripts. Separate adding & getting the city for better dev UX.

### Add Actions.createRoundabout() helper function

userscripts

editor is enabled or not

### Add information about logged in user to State.userInfo

## v2.233

### Add Shortcuts.isShortcutRegistered() method

add a helper method to check if a shortcut (action) has already been
registered

### Add Sidebar.registerScriptTab() & removeScriptTab()

Add methods to create and remove script tabs. The registerScriptTab()
waits for tab label and tab pane elements to be connected to the DOM.
The waitForElementConnected() is integrated into the registerScriptTab()
so there's no need to export it separately.

### Add Sidebar.getSelection() and .setSelection() methods

Add SDK methods to query and replace current selection.

### Add wme-selection-changed event

trigger wme-selection-changed event when selecting or unselected data
model objects

### Add Shortcuts.getAllShortcuts()

add a helper method to list all userscript shortcuts

### Add Shortcuts.createShortcut() and Shortcuts.deleteShortcut()

Add a method to create and delete shortcuts. Shortcuts created with SDK
have a forUserscript: true on them. Its impossible to delete a shortcut
that wasn't created through the SDK.
Shortcuts become visible in the shortcuts editor. Shortcut description
becomes injected into I18n like WazeWrap does.

### Add Shortcuts.addShortcutGroup()

Add helper function to register a new shortcut group. The new group
becomes visible in the keyboard shortcuts dialog. The group name is
injected into I18n translations using technique similar to what WazeWrap
does.
Shortcuts e2e tests were extracted into a separate module.
Introduced a generic InternalWMEError that indicates that some
assumptions about how WME works were broken.

### Add DataModel.Segments.getAddress()

### Add multiple fields to the DataModel.Segment

add unit test to check if all the fields are present

### Add DataModel.RoadTypes.getAll()

## v2.232

### Add props to city interface

Add properties to the city interface returned
by sdk method:

- countryId

- isEmpty
These properties are referenced in top scripts.

### Add getAll/getById for users

### Add States.getById

Add method to get a state by id.

### Add get by id for models

- Streets (b/340742761)

- Segments (b/340742659)

- Venues

### Add get all segments

### Add get all streets

### Add 'abbr' property to country

Add property 'abbr' to the country interface used
by the SDK. Prop is used by top downloaded
script.

### Add get all venues

### Return facades over data models

Instead of returning instances of data models
from SDK methods, create facades over those models.
Returning JSON objects instead of internal data models
will decouple the WME internals from the userscripts
relying on the SDK, allowing internal changes to
be done freely without breaking usages.
Furthermore, changes to the SDK interfaces will be
recognized and announced to the community when
changed.

### Align get top city

Change method to get top city instead of
city id. This is to align with the getters
for top country and state.

## v2.231

### Add isTollSegment to sdk

Add new method to SegmentsRestrictionsUseCase to
detect if a segment has a toll-free restriction.
Update unit tests for SegmentsRestrictionsUseCase.

add sdk helper function to undo all stacked actions

### Add Editing.redo()

### Add Editing.undo()

an InvalidStateError if there's nothing to save or save is not allowed.
The save also doesn't support edit suggestions yet.

## v2.230

also introduce a generic error for missing elements

### Define a withSDK helper function for e2e tests

the withSDK helper function simplifies writing tests for sdk functions

## v2.227

### Define a WmeSDK interface

this results into more readable type suggestions in LSP / IDEs

## v2.224

### Add Map.getZoomLevel() function
