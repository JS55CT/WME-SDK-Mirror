# WME SDK Docs — Update Workflow Guide

## Overview

There are **6 scripts**, run in this order every time you update the SDK mirror:

```text
1. cleanup.py              <- wipe old .md output
2. build-url-list.py       <- discover all page URLs from the live SPA
3. download-pages.py       <- download fresh HTML files
4. extract-to-md.py        <- convert HTML -> individual .md files
5. create-grouped-md-files.py  <- bundle .md files for LLM use
6. update-skill.py         <- pull latest WME SDK skill from Claude Code
```

> All scripts must be run from the **`latest/`** folder as your working directory.
> **Why not HTTrack?** The Waze SDK docs site is a Single-Page App (SPA) — all navigation is built by JavaScript at runtime, so traditional crawlers like HTTrack can only download `index.html` and nothing else. These scripts bypass that by reading TypeDoc's embedded `navigationData` JS bundle directly.

---

## Prerequisites

One-time setup — install Python dependencies once. On Windows, use the `py` launcher:

```powershell
py -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

---

## Step 1 — `cleanup.py` (Reset old output)

**What it does:** Deletes all `.md` files and `-clean.html` files from these subfolders:
`classes`, `documents`, `functions`, `interfaces`, `modules`, `types`, `variables`, `NotebookLM`

**When to run it:** Every time before you re-process new HTML. Skipping this risks mixing stale `.md` files from a previous run with new ones.

```powershell
py cleanup.py
```

---

## Step 2 — `build-url-list.py` (Discover all page URLs)

**What it does:** Fetches `assets/navigation.js` from the live site, decodes TypeDoc's
`window.navigationData` (a base64+zlib compressed JSON tree of the entire sidebar),
and walks every node to produce a complete list of all documentation page URLs.

**Output:**

- `url-list.txt` — one full URL per line (used by Step 3)
- `url-list-paths.txt` — relative paths only (useful for diffing against local mirror)

```powershell
py build-url-list.py
```

**Options:**

```powershell
py build-url-list.py --base-url https://www.waze.com/editor/sdk/  # default
py build-url-list.py --out my-urls.txt                            # custom output file
```

---

## Step 3 — `download-pages.py` (Download fresh HTML)

**What it does:** Reads `url-list.txt` and downloads each HTML page into the correct
local subfolder (`classes/`, `interfaces/`, `types/`, etc.) — exactly the structure
that `extract-to-md.py` expects.

Also downloads `wme-sdk-typings.tgz` from the live site and extracts
`wmeSDK_typedefs.d.ts` into the `TypeDefs/` folder, keeping type definitions
in sync with the HTML docs on every refresh.

By default runs **incrementally** — skips files that already exist locally. Use
`--force` to re-download everything.

```powershell
py download-pages.py
```

**Options:**

```powershell
py download-pages.py --dry-run     # preview what would be saved, no files written
py download-pages.py --force       # re-download all files even if they exist
py download-pages.py --no-typedefs # skip the typings tarball download
py download-pages.py --delay 0.5   # seconds between requests (default: 0.3)
```

> **TypeDefs note:** `wmeSDK_typedefs.d.ts` comes from the tarball. `geojson_typeddefs.d.ts`
> is sourced separately and is not updated by this script.

---

## Step 4 — `extract-to-md.py` (HTML -> Markdown)

**What it does:** Reads every `.html` file in the root `latest/` folder and all
subfolders, parses the TypeDoc HTML structure using BeautifulSoup, and writes a
matching `.md` file next to each `.html` file.

It handles:

- Class/interface/type/function pages -> structured Markdown with TypeScript code blocks
- `modules.html` -> table of contents with `.md` links
- `documents/CHANGELOG.html` -> clean changelog Markdown
- Adds YAML frontmatter to every file (`title`, `source`, `created`, `tool`, `notes`)

```powershell
py extract-to-md.py
```

**Output:** One `.md` file per `.html` file, placed alongside the source HTML in each subfolder.

---

## Step 5 — `create-grouped-md-files.py` (Bundle for LLM)

**What it does:** Takes all the individual `.md` files from Step 4 and assembles them
into the `NotebookLM/` folder.

| Output file       | Source                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `classes.md`      | All `.md` files from `classes/`                              |
| `modules.md`      | All `.md` files from `modules/`                              |
| `types.md`        | All `.md` files from `types/`                                |
| `interfaces.md`   | All `.md` files from `interfaces/`                           |
| `variables.md`    | All `.md` files from `variables/`                            |
| `functions.md`    | All `.md` files from `functions/`                            |
| `changelog.md`    | Copied from `documents/CHANGELOG.md`                         |
| `*.md` (typedefs) | Wraps each `.d.ts` from `TypeDefs/` in a markdown code block |
| Guide `.md` files | Copied from `guides/`                                        |
| External docs     | Copied from `externalDocs/`                                  |
| `index.md`        | Master index with TOC, SDK version, and source guide         |

```powershell
py create-grouped-md-files.py
```

---

## Step 6 — `update-skill.py` (Sync WME SDK Skill)

**What it does:** Pulls the latest WME SDK skill from your Claude Code skills directory
(`~/.claude/skills/wme-sdk/SKILL.md`) and saves a copy to the local `skills/` folder.

This keeps your skill versioned alongside the SDK documentation it references, so skill updates
are tracked in git and always available offline.

**Output:**

- `skills/SKILL.md` — Copy of your WME SDK skill from Claude Code

The script compares content before writing — if the skill hasn't changed, it skips the write
and reports `[OK]`.

```powershell
py update-skill.py
```

**Options:**

```powershell
py update-skill.py --skill-path C:\custom\path\to\SKILL.md  # custom skill location
```

> **Note:** If the skill is not found at the default location (`~/.claude/skills/wme-sdk/SKILL.md`),
> the script reports an error. Verify the skill exists or use `--skill-path` to specify a custom location.

---

## Full Run (Copy-Paste)

```powershell
cd "c:/Users/Jstrand/OneDrive - FactSet/Personal/waze stuff/WAZE SDK Mirror/WME SDK/web-assets.waze.com/wme_sdk_docs/production/latest"
py cleanup.py; py build-url-list.py; py download-pages.py; py extract-to-md.py; py create-grouped-md-files.py; py update-skill.py
```

---

## What Gets Updated

After the run, you'll have:

**Documentation (in `NotebookLM/`):**

- `index.md` — start here; has the TOC and source guide
- `classes.md`, `interfaces.md`, `types.md`, `functions.md`, `variables.md`, `modules.md`
- `changelog.md`
- `*.md` typedef files (wrapping the `.d.ts` sources)
- Guide files (`how-to-get-started-with-the-wmeSDK.md`, `migration-guide.md`, etc.)

**Skill (in `skills/`):**

- `SKILL.md` — Your WME SDK skill, ready to use with Claude Code

Load the documentation files into your LLM context (NotebookLM, Claude, etc.) for complete,
up-to-date SDK reference. The skill is automatically available in your `~/.claude/skills/`
when you develop WME scripts.
